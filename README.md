# Project: Testing Practice

## Overview

[Project testing practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) has been set as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). After being itroduced to Jest in previous lessons, the assignment was set to write tests for five functions.

## Assets

- [Caesar Cipher](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/)

## Obejective
Write tests for the following, and using Jest make the tests pass!
1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character ‚Äúshifted‚Äù.

- Don‚Äôt forget to test wrapping from z to a.
- Don‚Äôt forget to test keeping the same case.
- Don‚Äôt forget to test punctuation!
- For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few smaller functions. One concept of Testing is that you don‚Äôt need to explicitly test every function you write‚Ä¶ Just the public ones. So in this case you only need tests for the final caesarCipher function. If it works as expected you can rest assured that your smaller helper functions are doing what they‚Äôre supposed to.
5. An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
```
const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
  average: 4,
  min: 1,
  max: 8,
  length: 6
};
```
